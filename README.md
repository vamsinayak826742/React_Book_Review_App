# Book Review App

This is a simple Book Review application built using React. It allows users to display a list of books and their reviews. The app fetches data from an API and handles asynchronous loading of book data.

## Features

- Display a list of books with their titles.
- Fetch book data asynchronously (e.g., from a backend API).
- Display a loading state while data is being fetched.
- Error handling if the book data is not available.

## Installation

Follow the steps below to run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/book-review-app.git
   cd book-review-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   or, if using Yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   or, if using Yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

   This will start the app on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Once the app is running, it will fetch book data from an API and display a list of books. Each book will have its title shown in a simple list format. If the data is still being fetched, a "Loading..." message will be shown.

### BookList Component

The `BookList` component is used to display the list of books. It receives a `books` array as a prop. The `map` method is used to iterate over the array and display the title of each book.

```jsx
const BookList = ({ books = [] }) => {
    return (
        <div>
            {books.length > 0 ? (
                books.map((book) => (
                    <div key={book.id}>{book.title}</div>
                ))
            ) : (
                <div>No books available</div>
            )}
        </div>
    );
};
```

### Fetching Data Asynchronously

Book data is fetched asynchronously from an API and stored in the state. Initially, the state is an empty array. Once the data is fetched successfully, the state is updated with the list of books.

```jsx
const [books, setBooks] = React.useState([]);

React.useEffect(() => {
    fetch('/api/books')
        .then((response) => response.json())
        .then((data) => setBooks(data))
        .catch((error) => console.error('Error fetching books:', error));
}, []);
```

### Handling Loading and Errors

While the data is being fetched, a loading message is displayed. If an error occurs during the data fetching process, an error message is logged to the console.

```jsx
return books.length > 0 ? (
    <BookList books={books} />
) : (
    <div>Loading...</div>
);
```
